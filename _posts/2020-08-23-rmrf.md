# Warningâš 
If you run ``sudo rm -rf /*`` directly,DON'T ASK ME why the system isn't start.If you are curious in that,you can download a VM and run it in the VM. I promise after running,your system won't work properly!

## Why it works:
```
root# rm -rf /*
=
root# rm -rf /bin /boot /dev /etc /home /lib /lib64 /lost+found /media /misc /mnt /net /nfs /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var
```
